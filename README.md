# Hi there, I'm Behzad Ousat! 👋

## 🎓 About Me

I am a **Ph.D. candidate** at Florida International University, working as a **Research Assistant** at the **Systems Security Lab (SecLab)** under the supervision of **Dr. Amin Kharraz**. My research focuses on utlizing **data-driven and machine learning techniques** to detect emerging threats for web application. This includes analyzing **LLM-based browser agents** and automated interactions in the age of the agentic web, as well as developing models to distinguish **human behavior from automated agents**.
In addition to my academic research, I have experience as a **Site Reliability Engineer and Software Engineer**, with a strong background in **Linux** administration, network protocols, and **DevOps** practices, and proven ability to adapt between software engineering, infrastructure operations, and research.

## 🏢 Professional Experience

### 🎓 Graduate Research Assistant | Florida International University (2022 - Present)
- Developed end-to-end ML pipelines using Pandas, PyTorch, and Scikit-Learn to collect and analyze billions of real-world noisy browser interaction artifacts, classifying human vs automated agents with 95%.
- Trained and fine-tuned deep learning models on terabytes of PCAP data to detect zero-day network attack classes, deploying Open Set Recognition models to classify unknown traffic with 85% accuracy.
- Built and evaluated LLM-powered Browser Agents with prompt optimization, achieving >90% success in web crawling tasks and producing large-scale labeled behavioral datasets for downstream modeling.
- Developed large-scale Object Detection pipelines trained on millions of text CAPTCHAs, achieving 80%+ solve rates across 1M+ production websites, enabling empirical analysis of CAPTCHA prevalence.
- Built large-scale web crawling and analysis pipelines for nearly 30K reported vulnerabilities from across 10+ package ecosystems, identifying trends, malicious packages, and supply-chain attack patterns.
- Investigated development practices, code reuse, and popular packages in over 300K Phishing websites in collaborations with Microsoft Security, enabling scalable detection of malicious websites. (DIMVA ’24).

### 🚀 Platform Technical Team Lead | Tapsi (2017 - 2021)
- Led platform team to migrate 60+ microservices to Kubernetes, Coordinated with backend teams, onboarded
developers on technical workflows through workshops, and presented improvements to stakeholders.
- Maintained 99% uptime for microservices by operating infrastructure of over 100 Ubuntu servers for compute
clusters and databases across Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.
- Established On-call Program to handle ad hoc requests, shielding infrastructure engineers from interruptions.
- Reduced deployment errors and established automated rollouts by implementing CI/CD pipelines to include canary-testing, staging, and production environments utilizing Bash and Ansible.
- Developed scalable Node.js and Python message passing libraries based on gRPC and RabbitMQ, integrating Prometheus and Grafana dashboards, reducing Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) by 50%.
